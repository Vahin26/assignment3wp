<h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>Urad Dal – Urad Dal is the main ingredient – choose light colored, unpolished dal for making Medu Vada. Urad Dal, Black Gram (English) all means Urad Dal.</li>
<li>Flavor – Hing, ginger and curry leaves adds flavor to Medu Vada. These ingredients are added to the urad dal batter as such and need not be ground.</li>
<li>Others – Small Onions & Green Chillies give a balancing taste to Medu Vada – hence do not skip it.</li>
<li>Oil – Use refined oil available at stores. For a healthier option, you can use sesame / groundnut oil too. </li>
</ul>
<h2>RECIPE TO MAKE VADA:</h2><br>
<ul><li>Soaking – Rinse 1 cup urad dal well to remove the starchy coating. Rinse it atleast 2 times then drain water.</li>
<li>Add it to a bowl and Soak in water for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Keep it undisturbed for 2 hours.</li>
<li>After 2 hours rinse it again and drain water completely.</li>
<li>Grinding – To a mixer jar – add the drained urad dal.</li>
<li>Chill 1 cup water and keep it ready. We may not end up using it fully. Adding chill water for grinding avoids mixer jar from getting heated up. Alternatively you can use icecubes too. You can use regular water itself if you are grinding the batter in grinder.</li>
<li>Add 3-4 tablespoon first to it. Start grinding add little by little later while grinding.</li>
<li>Batter consistency – Add chill water little by little to grind it to a thick smooth fluffy batter. Make sure to add very little water to grind else you will end up in a runny batter.</li>
<li>Now transfer the batter to a big wide mixing bowl so that it is easy to mix.</li>
<li>Fluff it well for 2 mins. You can use your hand or a spatula or even whisk. Beat it well for 1-2 mins not more than that. </li>
<li>Now add a pinch of batter to a bowl containing water. It should float like butter then the batter is perfect.</li>
<li>Adding condiments – Now to the batter add 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, 2 small green chillies finely chopped, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 1 tablespoon curry leaves, salt to taste and a pinch of hing. </li>
<li>Mix it well until evenly distributed.</li>
<li>Shaping vadas – Wet your hands by first dipping your fingers and palm in water this is to avoid batter from sticking while shaping the vada.</li>
<li>First grease a strainer or perforated laddle with oil. Take a portion of batter add it at the back of the strainer slightly flatten it and make a dent in the middle as shown. Flip and tap it hot oil or you can even dip in preheated oil.</li>
<li>Slightly flatten it and make a dent in the middle.</li>
<li>Frying the vadas – Heat oil – first add a pinch of batter the batter should come up immediately but oil should not be smoking hot.</li>
<li>Now oil is ready – shape and add the vadas. Add in batches, I usually add 3-5 vadas in a batch depends on the size of the kadai you are using.Let it cook for few seconds do not disturb.
<li>Once it comes up and looks golden at the sides, turn over using a laddle.Fry until golden brown on both the sides.Once golden brown and crisp its ready to remove.
