<br/><h2>ESTIMATED CALORIES INTAKE: </h2> <h3>387 Cal</h3>
<h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>Rice: Idli rice or dosa rice for best results.</li>
<li>Dal: Premium urad dal white in color (ulutham paruppu).</li>
<li>Other ingredients: Salt to taste and oil for cooking dosa.</li>
</ul>
<h2>RECIPE TO MAKE DOSA:</h2><br>><p>
<ul><li>Add urad dal in one bowl, wash it nicely in water a couple of times, and drain. Now soak it with fresh water and leave it for 4 to 6 hours.</li>
<li>Similarly, in another bowl, add rice. Wash it nicely a couple of times and drain. Add fresh water and soak for 4 to 6 hours.</li>
<li>Grind the dal: Drain the water from the dal. Add the drained dal to the wet grinder or mixie jar with ½ cup water and grind to a thick, smooth paste. Add water in increments and grind. Transfer the ground urad dal to a large vessel or conatiner.</li>
<li>Grind the rice: Drain the water from the rice. Add rice with ½ cup of water to a wet grinder or mixie jar and blend it until it is smooth. Add water in increments as needed.
Transfer this ground rice to the ground urad dal and mix.</li>
<li>Dosa Batter: The fermented batter is generally going to be thick. Add salt and a little water based on the consistency of the fermented batter and mix. Undisturbed batter, once fermented, can be stored for 5 to 6 days</li>
<li>Grease a cast iron skillet or non-stick pan with oil. Ensure no excess oil is left and it is absorbed completely</li>
<li>Heat dosa tawa on medium flame</li>
<li>Once hot, pour a ladle full of batter at the center and spread it in a circular motion. If you are not able to spread quickly, it means your batter is too thick. You may add a little extra water to the batter and mix.</li>
<li>Drizzle oil or ghee around the edges. In 2 to 3 minutes, the edges will start to come off, and the bottom of the dosa will start turning golden brown.</li>
<li>Remove the dosa from the pan or flip and cook for another 1 minute if you like. Flipping is optional for this dosa. </li>
<li>Before spreading the next dosa, you may grease the pan with oil or ghee and remove excess oil using a clean kitchen towel.</li>
<li>Keep any leftover batter in the refrigerator. </li>
